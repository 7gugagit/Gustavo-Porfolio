# MilkMattersDonorApp
This is a Flutter app created by myself and 2 collegues as a Thesis for our Honours degree at the University of Cape Town.
We worked closely with a NGO called Milk Matters, that works with donor mothers to collect human breast milk for 
premature babies in hospital who do not have access to it. They are a wonderful organization and I learned so much
working with them!

# Getting Started
To build and compile both an iOS and Android version of this application, one needs to use both Android Studio and XCode.
XCode provides the required tools (and MacOS environment) to build the iOS application.

These instructions will help to get the basic development environment up and running.

Step 1: Download and install Flutter (instructions can be found here: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). 
When building this mobile app, please use the stable Flutter channel by running "flutter channel stable" and then "flutter upgrade".

Step 2: Download and install your preferred IDE (Android Studio is recommended for Flutter Android development, while XCode is recommended for Flutter iOS development: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor)

Step 3: Import the project into your IDE. 

Step 4: Build the project

If you would like to demo the app on a device, you can create a simulated device (in Android Studio and XCode) or connect a device on which the app will be installed. The app can then be run and built from the IDE and installed on the device!
