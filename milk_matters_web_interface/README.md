# Milk Matters
This is a Flutter app created by myself and 2 collegues as a Thesis for our Honours degree at the University of Cape Town.
We worked closely with a NGO called Milk Matters, that works with donor mothers to collect human breast milk for 
premature babies in hospital who do not have access to it. They are a wonderful organization and I learned so much
working with them!
