This is a project I completed for an AI course with a friend, Dino, which the goal was to find a dataset fit for Machine Learning,
and choose and train a suited model to make predictions on a metric of our choosing. We decided to try and predict if a student's
behaviour and records in school have correlation to weekend drinking. This was one of my favorite projects that I have ever done
and it is now a big area of interest for me.
